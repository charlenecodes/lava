        <h1><mark>About Me </mark></h1>
          <p>I am an American-educated Physical Therapist with clinical experience in both the United States and Switzerland. I completed my Bachelor of Science in Health, Exercise, and Sport Sciences as well as my Doctor of Physical Therapy degrees at University of the Pacific in Stockton, California.</p>
          <p>The challenges I faced as a healthcare professional and in my personal life has proved that I can thrive in the face of adversity. I have proven time and again that I can overcome any challenge that arises. Recently, this has been the career switch, pushed by burnout during the pandemic.</p>
          <p>I am a good candidate because I have many transferable skills gained through my life and work experiences. I have a good command of multiple languages and can adapt well in different environments. I have lived in 3 continents, where the cultures and languages vary significantly. I also work very hard, especially when I have set goal that I want to accomplish. This is proven through my recent move to Switzerland, where I had a few months to learn German and pass the language exam in order to work in a new country with a new language, dialects, and culture.</p>
